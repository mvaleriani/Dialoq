# Dialoq
[Live Demo](http://dialoq.io/#/)

Dialoq is a dynamic chat-based application, inspired by Slack and Discord. Ruby on Rails is used as its backend MVC, with Postgresql for database management/querying. The site also utilizes [lottie-web](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web) for fluid, visually-appealing UI animations.

I built and designed the project over a 10-day period.

## Features
* Encrypted login (frontend to backend) using BCrypt with protected routes
* Users can create Servers for any topic
* Users can create sub-chatrooms within a Server
* Live messaging with websockets 
* Search functionality (to join servers, add friends, create private rooms etc.)
